# Binary-Image-Classifier

This project modifies the ResNet18 Model CNN model trained on the ImageNet dataset by changing its final classification layer to distinguish between the M24 Chaffee and the M551 Sheridan. These are both tanks used during the Korean and Vietnam Wars respectively.

# Results
The model is able to achieve a 99% test accuracy after training done with a training dataset consisting of 1200 images and validation with 300 images. 


# Dataset Creation

A full dataset was created using a [Bing Images Scraper](https://github.com/gurugaurav/bing_image_downloader)
